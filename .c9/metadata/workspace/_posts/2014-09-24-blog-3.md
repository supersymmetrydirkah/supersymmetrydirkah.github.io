What a simple concept, I canâ€™t believe that nobody has beat this into my head before coming to the yard.  Thank you!  A basic yet essential thought process that can help eliminate time suckers and allow more attention to detail through the practices of focus and discipline.  What did I accomplish yesterday, what do I want to accomplish today and what are my barriers from allowing me to accomplish those goals.  Each part is equally important to get the desired efficiency that goes along with any body who has a busy schedule and fleeting time.  Breaking each problem down into smaller parts is usually the best way to build up to something great.  Big things have small beginnings.  This practice applies to both professional and personal lives and is a wonderful tool for help to keep the synergy of a team tight."}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"action":"removeText","range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":521},"end":{"row":0,"column":522}},"text":" "}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"action":"removeText","range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":797},"end":{"row":0,"column":798}},"text":" "}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"action":"removeText","range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":796},"end":{"row":0,"column":797}},"text":"r"}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"action":"removeText","range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":795},"end":{"row":0,"column":796}},"text":"o"}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"action":"removeText","range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":794},"end":{"row":0,"column":795}},"text":"f"}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"action":"insertText","range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":794},"end":{"row":0,"column":795}},"text":"t"}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"action":"insertText","range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":795},"end":{"row":0,"column":796}},"text":"o"}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"action":"insertText","range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":796},"end":{"row":0,"column":797}},"text":" "}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"action":"removeText","range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":803},"end":{"row":0,"column":804}},"text":"o"}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"action":"removeText","range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":802},"end":{"row":0,"column":803}},"text":"t"}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"action":"removeText","range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":801},"end":{"row":0,"column":802}},"text":" "}]}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":0,"scrollleft":5605,"selection":{"start":{"row":0,"column":801},"end":{"row":0,"column":801},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":6,"mode":"ace/mode/markdown"}},"timestamp":1411923275941,"hash":"a66f27f221eb93c04a025b46de6e65de271c752f"}
