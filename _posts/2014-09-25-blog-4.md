2014-09-25/Status Add Commit!  First major lesson learned was that I need to read the entire assignment (problem/project) before I try to solve it.  For some reason I felt that it was so necessary to spend all of my time trying to watch tutorials and practice git commands, etc.  Everything that was at the beginning of the assignment.  Instead I should’ve focused on the overall concept.  In order to be fully in tune, one/the group must understand the approach applied by the leader.  Just like in a band…all tuning to one instrument is key to tickling the eardrums in the right fashion.  Managing priorities is crucial.  The questions that I will always ask myself with any problem/project that is ever thrown at me again: What do I absolutely need to accomplish by the end of this assignment? What can I go back to and sharpen up on later.  The basic concept of any problem/project must be fully realized in order to progress forward efficiently.
