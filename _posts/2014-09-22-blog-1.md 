2014-09-22/first day of class!  After you deal with enough assholes to last a few lifetimes…you come to truly appreciate cool peeps when you cross paths with them.  Meeting the new team was awesome.  A group of very special people have all gathered to meet at one amazing portal.  The land of coffee and iron.  Recently I moved to the great state of Florida and I have yet to really settle in.  You know how it is when you leave love ones behind and embark on a journey of a lifetime.  Orlando is a mysterious place filled with never ending dreams and clouds of imagination depositing its riches to anyone who is willing to dance in the rain.  Those riches come in many forms, I guess the only thing that really matters is that you need to know what you’re really in it for.  I’m glad that I pulled the trigger and went all in with Orlando.  Everything seems to be happenin right now…the Sun Rail…Tech Week…downtown renovations...I am excited to see what awaits further on down the trail.
