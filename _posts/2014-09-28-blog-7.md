2014-09-28/Are we there yet?  I will keep this one short and sweet.  I can’t make any promise on actually keeping up this blog train to makes stops 7 days a week… :-0  This sprint marathon will change us forever.  Even after the class is completed, the lesson will never stop being learned… so much to learn - so little time to do it.  One step at a time.  Acclimatizing together will be our savior,  we’re all in this together.
