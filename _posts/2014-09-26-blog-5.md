2014-09-26/Buy the ticket-take the ride.  I started from absolute zero… that’s -459.67 degrees fahrenheit on the thermometer of knowledge with what we built this week.  I have to admit I did have my first drowning experience this week.  Luckily I did submit and roll over onto my back.  You hear it all the time...they were such a strong swimmer how could this happen.  How you deal with pressure and panic is the determining factor to the end result.  I have plenty of experience with both sides of that coin...not all results are your desired result but, learning how to handle failure is one of the biggest keys to life.  We fail a lot more than we succeed.  A major league hitter fails 7 out of 10 times to become a hall of famer.  A “successful” major league pitcher starts over 30 times a year and usually only ends up with half of those starts adding to their win total.  Like in californication…when Hank tells his daughter that the best thing she could do was throw the book into the garbage... right after she got done spouting off about how proud she was of her first book.  Clean slates are the key…using a short memory in certain situations prevents us from getting stuck…whether it’s a good moment or a bad moment…we always have to remind ourselves why are we doing this… trying to write the most beautiful log of code is not the objective.  Writing code to solve a problem is the objective.  How can I put these pieces together to make this work?
