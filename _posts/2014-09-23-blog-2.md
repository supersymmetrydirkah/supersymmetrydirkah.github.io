2014-09-23/Team work makes a dream work.  After the honeymoon is over and the real work starts…a certain amount of stress is involved.  Dealing with adversity and being able to understand the difference between bad stress and good stress is the key to allowing yourself to not get too distracted from the reality of the situation.  A mountain of new information has been thrown at us…all which is totally foreign to my current skillset.  I can tell that we have different levels of understanding amongst the group.  The sooner that we all get on the same page the stronger the unit will become.
